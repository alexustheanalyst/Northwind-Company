# Northwind-Company
My SQL code developed to complete an end-to-end data warehouse solution based on business requirements
Using Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio and sample Northwind databases, I designed an OLAP schema, created and populated fact and dimensions from OLTP databases following up with queries to answer business questions using the data warehouse. Requirements of the company included analysis of their OLTP databases to design and populate a data warehouse for the company to help their managers analyze sales data and make decisions.
